Migration from v1.6.0 to v1.6.1.

Upgrade-tooling patch. v1.6.0 shipped scripts/migrations/v154_to_v160.py
without registering it in scripts/upgrade.py — the import block, the
LATEST_VERSION constant, and the MIGRATIONS list were then three hand-synced
places, and only two of the three were updated. The
result: LATEST_VERSION was left at "1.5.4" and Migration154to160 was never
imported or appended to MIGRATIONS, so upgrades silently stopped at 1.5.4 —
reporting success — even though the migration file itself was correct. v1.6.1 wires
both omissions in: Migration154to160 is now imported and appended, and
Migration160to161 (this migration) is imported and appended immediately
after it, with LATEST_VERSION set to "1.6.1".

This is a tooling-only patch — no layout, include, style, script, or
language-pack file changes, no `_config.yml` key changes, and no CSV/story
schema changes. Existing stories, objects, and configuration keep working
without edits.

Per the established convention for this upgrade engine (documented in every
migration since v1.4.0->v1.5.0: upgrade.py, the migrations package, base.py,
and messages.py are excluded from FRAMEWORK_FILES and ship out of band, via
the verified release tarball, rather than through a running migration's own
fetch/write step), this migration does not re-fetch or rewrite upgrade.py or
itself. By the time any migration in the chain executes, the site is already
running the target version's engine code — that engine code is exactly what
this migration's own fix lives in, and it reaches a site the same way every
other engine change has: as part of the v1.6.1 release, not as a
FRAMEWORK_FILES entry. There is nothing else for this migration to change on
a site, so apply() only records that the fix is internal to the upgrade
tooling.

The version stamp (telar.version -> 1.6.1) is not written here. upgrade.py
applies it once after every migration step succeeds, so a failed step can
never leave the site stamped as a version it is not running.

Version: v1.7.0
