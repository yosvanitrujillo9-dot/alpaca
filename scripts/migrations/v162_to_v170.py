Migration from v1.6.2 to v1.7.0.

v1.7.0 is a stewardship release: most of what changed is in how a site is
built, upgraded and tested rather than in what a reader sees. Three kinds of
change reach an existing site, and they arrive in that order.

1. Framework files (FRAMEWORK_FILES, installed atomically from the v1.7.0
   tag). The set is exactly the files a site owns that v1.7.0 adds or
   rewrites: the root manifests (`.gitattributes`, `.ruby-version`, `Gemfile`,
   `Gemfile.lock`,
   `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `README.md`,
   `CHANGELOG.md`), the three page layouts and the IIIF URL warning include,
   the rebuilt JavaScript bundles together with the modules they are built
   from, and the build scripts under `scripts/` — including the split of
   `scripts/telar/processors/objects.py` into a package. Nothing is derived at
   run time: the list is written out here so that what a site receives is a
   decision recorded in the release, not whatever a tree walk happens to
   return on the day the upgrade runs.

   Bundles and their sources ship together on purpose. `home-page.js`,
   `object-page.js`, `objects-filter.js`, `objects-index-page.js`,
   `share-panel.js`, `iiif-url-warning.js` and `telar-story.js` are built
   artefacts; the modules under the matching directories are what they are
   built from. A site that received one without the other would either run
   last release's behaviour from a bundle whose sources say otherwise, or
   rebuild into something the layouts do not load. `_apply_framework_files`
   fetches the whole map before writing any of it, so the set installs
   entirely or not at all.

2. Deletions (Phase 2). Two files v1.7.0 removes have to be removed from the
   site as well, because leaving them behind is worse than never having had
   them — see the phase's own comments.

3. `.gitignore` (Phase 3). `generate_collections.py` now records where each
   story renders, in `_data/telar-build/`, so the post-build encryption step
   never has to guess a URL. That directory is generated on every build and
   does not belong in a site's history.

`scripts/upgrade.py` IS delivered, and that is a departure from the
convention every migration since v1.5.0 has documented — that `upgrade.py`,
the `migrations` package, `base.py` and `messages.py` are excluded from
FRAMEWORK_FILES and ship out of band in the verified release tarball. The
convention is intact; the file it named has changed identity. As of v1.7.0
`scripts/upgrade.py` is no longer the upgrade engine. It is a launcher: it
asks GitHub which release is newest, downloads that release's tooling,
verifies it against the published checksum, and runs the engine from a
temporary directory. The engine is `telar_upgrade.py`, and that file — with
the whole of `scripts/migrations/` — still ships only in the tarball and is
still absent from FRAMEWORK_FILES.

Delivering the launcher is the point of this hop. A site's own copy of the
engine knows only the releases that existed when the copy was made: a site
created at v1.4.0 asks its own tooling what is current, is told v1.4.0, and
stays behind while reporting success. A launcher has nothing to be stale
about. Once a site holds it, `_site_runs_the_launcher` in the engine
recognises the marker `telar-upgrade-launcher-v1` in the delivered file, and
`_retire_local_migrations` clears the site's now-unrunnable
`scripts/migrations/` after the upgrade completes — which is why this
migration must not deliver those modules itself, and why the manifest that
accompanies this release deletes them for compositor-driven sites, whose
tree-diff adds files but does not remove them.

Also not delivered, for reasons that have not changed:

  - `tests/` — Telar's own framework tests, which have never been a site's
    to run.
  - `.github/workflows/*` — the upgrade's GITHUB_TOKEN carries no
    `workflows: write`, so a push touching any of them is rejected outright.
    The restriction is as old as v0.6.3. Three workflow files changed in
    v1.7.0 and all three are manual steps below.
  - `_config.yml` — a site's configuration is the site's, and v1.7.0 adds no
    key that needs writing into it.
  - `.gitignore` — edited in place in Phase 3 rather than overwritten, so a
    site's own entries survive.

Fail closed: if the framework install returns any FAILED record, apply()
returns immediately and neither the deletions nor the `.gitignore` edit run.
A site that could not receive the new layouts must not lose the script the
old ones load.

The version stamp (telar.version -> 1.7.0) is not written here. upgrade.py
applies it once after every migration step succeeds, so a failed step can
never leave the site stamped as a version it is not running.

        `assets/js/iiif-thumbnails.js` was one script doing the thumbnail work

        into per-page bundles — `home-page.js` and `objects-index-page.js` —
        and the layouts installed in Phase 1 no longer load the old file. Left

        `scripts/telar/processors/objects.py` is the sharper case. v1.7.0

Instala al menos la versión 3.2 antes de la próxima construcción local. Y `scripts/upgrade.py` ya no es la herramienta de actualización, sino un lanzador: al ejecutarlo, descarga las herramientas verificadas del lanzamiento más reciente y con ellas actualiza el sitio. Así, tu copia de `scripts/upgrade.py` nunca vuelve a quedarse atrás, por mucho tiempo que pase entre una actualización y otra.''',

En el índice de objetos, la búsqueda encuentra palabras completas, además de los comienzos de palabra. En los objetos de una sola página, las coordenadas que copias ya no traen número de página. Y si el identificador de una historia protegida lleva un guion bajo, la construcción ahora cifra el texto de la historia en la página que Jekyll produce realmente para ella.''',
