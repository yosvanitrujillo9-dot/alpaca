Base Migration Machinery for Telar Upgrades

This module deals with the shared scaffolding every version-specific
migration builds on — `BaseMigration`, the structured result types it
returns, and the helpers that touch a user's site safely. Each migration
in this package subclasses `BaseMigration`, sets its `from_version` /
`to_version` / `_TARGET_TAG`, and implements `check_applicable()` and
`apply()`; everything else here exists so that those subclasses stay
small and so that a half-finished upgrade never corrupts a live site.

`ChangeStatus` and `ChangeRecord` are the vocabulary a migration uses to
report what happened. A migration returns a list of `ChangeRecord`s, each
carrying a human-readable description, an APPLIED/FAILED/SKIPPED status,
and a `severity` — `hard` means a FAILED record must abort the whole
upgrade (no version stamp, non-zero exit), `soft` means surface it for
attention but keep going. Replacing the old flat list-of-strings lets the
upgrade pipeline tell success from failure instead of rendering every
line as a completed checklist item.

`apply_config_version()` is the single source of truth for rewriting the
`telar.version` / `telar.release_date` stamp in `_config.yml`. It edits
text rather than round-tripping YAML so comments and formatting survive,
and both `BaseMigration` (per migration) and `upgrade.py` (the final
stamp) call it so the parsing rules cannot drift between two copies.

`BaseMigration` itself groups its helpers by concern. File primitives
(`_read_file`, `_write_file`, `_move_file`, `_file_exists`) work relative
to the repo root. Content helpers handle the recurring jobs of an upgrade
— ensuring the upgrade notice in `index.md`, topping up `.gitignore`,
stamping the config version. The staged-atomic block
(`_apply_framework_files` and its `_fetch_all_staged` / `_backup_existing`
/ `_commit_staged` / state-file companions) is the heart of the safety
model: framework files are fetched into memory first and written only if
every fetch succeeds, with backups and an `UPGRADE_STATE.json` marker so a
crash or write error mid-commit rolls back to the prior state. Fetches are
pinned to a release tag (`_TARGET_TAG`) so a re-run after a failure
re-fetches byte-identical content rather than blending across `main`
commits. `_detect_language()` reads the site's configured language for
bilingual summaries, and `_is_file_modified()` compares a file against its
original on a tag so demo cleanup can preserve user customisations.

The single `UPGRADE_STATE.json` file plays two roles — written
`in_progress` during an atomic framework write and removed on success (so
a crash mid-write is detectable), and written `failed` by `upgrade.py`
when an upgrade aborts on a HARD failure (so a re-run can tell the user
they are resuming). A clean success leaves no such file behind.
