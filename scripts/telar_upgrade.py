Telar Upgrade Script

When a new version of Telar is released, existing sites need to be
updated to match the new framework. This script automates that process
by detecting the site's current version and applying every migration
needed to reach the latest version.

Each migration is a Python class in scripts/migrations/ that knows how
to transform a site from one specific version to the next. Migrations
can add, modify, or delete files — for example, adding new layout
templates, updating _config.yml with new settings, or renaming
directories. The script chains these together: upgrading from v0.3.0
to v0.6.2 runs every intermediate migration in sequence.

After applying automated changes, the script regenerates all data files
(JSON, collections, IIIF tiles) to apply any new validation or
processing logic introduced in the new version. The output is an
UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md file listing every automated change made and any
manual steps the user still needs to complete. The --dry-run flag
previews what would happen without making changes.

This is the engine, not the entry point. A site's `scripts/upgrade.py` is a
launcher that downloads a verified copy of this file for the newest release
and runs it from a temp dir, so the version of this module that runs is
never the one sitting in the site. See scripts/upgrade.py.

Version: v1.7.0

Usage:
    python scripts/telar_upgrade.py              # Normal upgrade
    python scripts/telar_upgrade.py --dry-run    # Preview without applying
