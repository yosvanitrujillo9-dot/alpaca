"""
Unit tests for upgrade.get_migration_path strict version chaining.

A migration only joins the path when its from_version matches the version
reached so far; the old `or migrations_to_run` heuristic ran every later
migration once the list was non-empty, silently producing the wrong chain
across a version gap.

Version: v1.7.0
