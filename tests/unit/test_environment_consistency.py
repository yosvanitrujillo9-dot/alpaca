"""
Static consistency tests between what workflows/manifests declare and what
the code they run actually needs.

An upgrade workflow step that installs an ad-hoc package list instead of the
full manifest silently drifts as scripts/ grows new imports. A third-party
import added to scripts/ without a matching requirements.txt entry works
locally (already installed) and fails only in a clean CI/user environment.
A workflow `if:` guard that scopes framework tests to the framework's own
repos can be dropped in a rewrite without any test noticing. A migration
that ships package.json without package-lock.json (or vice versa) leaves
npm free to re-resolve versions instead of installing the pinned tree. A
supported Ruby declared only inside a workflow file is invisible to anyone
working locally, so bundler resolves a different gem set and rewrites the
lock without complaint.
These tests turn each of those mismatches into a CI failure at PR time.
