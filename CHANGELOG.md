# Changelog

All notable changes to Telar will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-09

Migration consolidation and stewardship release. This release rebuilds the upgrade path: one migration now carries a pre-v0.9.0 site forward where eighteen did, the engine reads the chain off the migration files instead of a hand-kept list, and a site's `scripts/upgrade.py` downloads and runs the newest release's verified tooling rather than the aging copy it came with. The encryption step now finds a protected story at the page Jekyll actually produced, so a story whose identifier contains an underscore builds again. The JavaScript that lived inside six layouts and includes now ships as bundles. Telar now needs Ruby 3.2, and the dependency floors move. The upgrade delivers every framework file on its own; you recopy three workflow files by hand (see Notes).

### Added

- **A carousel item can declare its size.** When an item gives `width` and `height`, the build never opens the image to measure it. Until now the build downloaded every carousel image just to read its aspect ratio, ten of them per story on a site with demo content, each with a ten-second timeout; offline, the fetch failed silently and the carousel fell back to its default height, so a carousel's layout depended on whether the build machine could reach the images that day. An item that declares nothing, or only one value, still goes through the measurement. The published demo bundles now carry the dimensions, so a site with demo content fetches nothing at build time on any framework version from 0.6.0 onward.

### Changed

- **Eighteen upgrade steps become one.** A site on any release from 0.2.0-beta to 0.8.1-beta now reaches 0.9.0-beta in a single hop. We checked the new step file by file against the old chain from every entry version and content state, and checked that the site it leaves still builds. The manual instructions collapsed with it: a site entering at 0.2.0-beta used to receive 43 separate instructions, among them three separate demands to replace the same workflow file and feature tours for releases it had never run. It now receives four, plus the demo-content notice. Two of the old instructions were also wrong: they pointed at a workflow file and a documentation page that a site at that version cannot use.
- **`scripts/upgrade.py` is now a launcher.** A site's copy of the upgrade tooling knows only the releases that existed when someone made the copy, so a site created at an older version could ask its own tooling, hear that it was current, and stay several releases behind while reporting success. `scripts/upgrade.py` now resolves the newest release, downloads its tooling, verifies the SHA-256, and runs the engine, `scripts/telar_upgrade.py`, from there, so a local upgrade always runs current code. After a full upgrade on a site that holds the launcher, the engine retires the site's own `scripts/migrations/` directory, since the migrations that run come down with the verified engine.
- **The engine discovers the upgrade chain from the migration files.** It reads the chain and the latest version off `scripts/migrations/` rather than a list kept by hand, so a migration cannot ship unregistered (which is what stopped v1.6.0's upgrade), and a chain with a gap or a duplicate entry point stops at once instead of running short and reporting success.
- **The engine accepts a `v`-prefixed version.** A `_config.yml` that reads `version: v1.6.2` now counts as that version instead of triggering an "unsupported version" report.
- **The build stops on a Jekyll destination conflict.** Jekyll reports two files claiming the same destination as a warning and then exits successfully, leaving a page silently missing from the site. The build workflow now reads the build log and fails on that warning, because on a site with protected stories the missing page can be the one a story's ciphertext lands on.
- **Page JavaScript has moved out of the layouts.** The object page, the home page, the objects index, the IIIF URL warning, the objects filter, and the share panel are now ES modules that esbuild bundles, one bundle per page, each declared in `package.json` and built by `npm run build:js`. The layouts and includes hand their data to the bundle in a JSON block instead of setting Liquid-written globals. Behavior does not change, and the layouts load the same script paths as before. Two consequences for sites that have gone beyond the template: if you have customized `_layouts/object.html`, `_layouts/index.html`, or `_layouts/objects-index.html`, the whole tail of the file changes on upgrade; and site JavaScript that read `window.TelarIIIF`, `window.objectsData`, or `window.telarIIIFWarningConfig` will not find them any more. We never documented any of the three.
- **Telar needs Ruby 3.2.** `Gemfile` now declares `ruby ">= 3.2", "< 4.0"`, and a new `.ruby-version` names 3.2.11, the interpreter CI builds with. `Gemfile.lock` resolves `public_suffix` 7, which needs Ruby 3.2; on an older Ruby, bundler did not fail but quietly resolved that gem back down and rewrote the lock file, so you could commit a lock that one machine had constrained and nothing would notice.
- **Dependency floors move up.** Python: pandas 3.0.5, markdown 3.10.3, cryptography 50.0.1, Pillow 12.3.0, PyMuPDF 1.28.2, pillow-heif 1.6.0, pytest 9.1.1, playwright 1.62.0, pytest-playwright 0.9.0. npm: Lenis 1.3.26, esbuild 0.28.2, jsdom 30.0.1, vitest 4.1.11. Behavior does not change.
- **Action pins move up** in all three workflows: `actions/checkout` v7, `actions/setup-python` v7, `actions/setup-node` v7, `actions/cache` v6, and `ruby/setup-ruby` at v1.321.0, still pinned by commit SHA.

### Fixed

- **A protected story whose identifier contains an underscore.** As it generates the site, `generate_collections.py` now records every story's rendered page under `_data/telar-build/`, and the encryption step reads that record instead of deriving a URL from the story identifier. A story identified as `my_story` renders at `/stories/my-story/`, and the encryption step used to look for it at the unslugified path and fail to find it. Two refusals come with the fix, both before the build writes any file: when two stories would render at the same page, the build stops and names both identifiers and the shared URL, where before it published one story and gave the other no page at all; and an authored page can no longer declare a story's URL as its own permalink and take that destination from the story.
- **The build clears protected stories' temporary pages unconditionally.** Telar renders each protected story's steps into a temporary page so the build's encryption step can read them, encrypt them into the story, and delete the page. That page holds the steps as plaintext and must never reach your published site. We found two conditions that could leave one behind, a build run before `project.json` existed and a build run with stories skipped, and nothing downstream would then remove it. The build now clears the pages at its start, before either condition can apply, and a build that still carries one with no protected story to claim it stops and names the pages instead of publishing them. You need to do nothing: a site that publishes through the "Build and Deploy Telar Site" workflow could not reach this, since git does not track the directory these pages live in and every run starts from a fresh checkout and regenerates the data files first. Reaching it meant building locally, in a working tree that already held one of these pages, and publishing that build by hand.
- **Whole-word search on the objects index.** The filter sent a query to the search index only in its prefix form, which bypasses the stemmer and matches against stems, so any whole word the English stemmer shortens found nothing: "landscape", "calibration", and any name it truncates returned no results. The filter now sends both the bare word and the prefix, so a whole word matches through the stemmer and a partial word still matches as a prefix.
- **Coordinates copied from a single-page object.** The copy button appended a page number to the coordinates of objects that have only one page. It now appends a page number only for multi-page objects; a multi-page PDF still copies its page.
- **PDF pages declared a single image size.** Each page's `info.json` listed only the smallest derivative that the tiler itself wrote, so the viewer and any tool that reads the manifest had a smaller thumbnail to choose from than the tiles on disk offered. Every page, and the object's root `info.json`, now declares all of the pre-generated sizes. Existing tile sets keep their old `info.json` until the site regenerates tiles, which the build workflow does when the images change.
- **A framework file that is an image now reaches the site.** The upgrade decoded every file it fetched as text, so it could not deliver a binary framework file at all, and the failure aborted the upgrade. It now carries fetched files as bytes where they are not text, through the staged write and the rollback backup alike.
- **A failed download no longer counts as a change applied.** Migrations now report a failed fetch in wording the engine reads as a failure, so an upgrade stops rather than reporting success without having delivered the file.
- **The upgrade speaks the site's language.** The records a failed upgrade writes into the upgrade summary, which you commit to your own repository, and the console output of the upgrade's steps now follow `telar_language` instead of appearing in English on a Spanish site.

### Removed

- **`assets/js/iiif-thumbnails.js`.** The thumbnail resolver it published as `window.TelarIIIF` now lives in `assets/js/iiif-thumbnails/`, and the home page and the objects index bundle it. Those two pages were its only readers.
- **`scripts/telar/processors/objects.py`.** The package at `scripts/telar/processors/objects/` replaces it. The upgrade deletes the old file as well as installing the package, since a site that holds both would import the package and leave the file inert but present.
- **The eighteen individual pre-0.9.0 migration modules**, `v020_to_v030.py` through `v081_to_v090.py`. The single `v020_to_v090.py` replaces them.

### Notes

- The "Upgrade Telar" workflow upgrades a site from v1.6.2 on its own, and chains through from earlier versions. Migration script: `scripts/migrations/v162_to_v170.py`.
- **You recopy three workflow files by hand** from the template unless you upgrade through the Telar Compositor, which updates all three on its own. GitHub does not allow the upgrade workflow to modify workflow files: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (the destination-conflict check and the new action pins), `.github/workflows/upgrade.yml` (it now runs the engine rather than the launcher, which would otherwise download the tooling a second time), and `.github/workflows/telar-tests.yml` (action pins).
- **Upgrading locally** now needs Ruby 3.2 or newer, and one extra step for a site that has never used the workflow: a site's own upgrade tooling knows only the releases that existed when someone copied it, so it cannot discover this release by itself. Install this release's `scripts/upgrade.py` once; from then on the launcher fetches the current tooling every time.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-17

Upgrade environment repair release. Fixes the "Upgrade Telar" GitHub Actions workflow, which has failed with a Python `ModuleNotFoundError` for every site upgrading to v1.5.0 or later — the workflow installed only two of the packages the upgrade's data-regeneration step needs. `upgrade.py` now installs its own dependencies as a fallback, so upgrades succeed even on sites whose workflow file predates this fix (GitHub does not allow automated upgrades to modify workflow files). Also repairs two regressions from earlier releases: a `package-lock.json` left out of sync by the v1.6.0 upgrade, and a missing guard that let Telar's internal framework tests run — and fail — on user sites. Tooling and workflows only — no site content, configuration, or display changes.

### Fixed

- **Upgrade workflow `ModuleNotFoundError`.** The "Upgrade Telar" GitHub Actions workflow installed only `pyyaml` and `pandas`, but the upgrade's data-regeneration step also needs `markdown`, `Pillow`, `jinja2`, and `cryptography`. No workflow-driven upgrade targeting v1.5.0 or later could have succeeded. The workflow now installs the full `requirements.txt`, matching the build workflow.
- **Upgrade tooling now self-sufficient.** `upgrade.py` installs its own dependencies from the release's tooling bundle before regenerating data, with a fallback to the site's own copy. This means upgrades succeed even on sites that haven't recopied the fixed workflow file above.
- **Corrected `package-lock.json`.** The v1.6.0 upgrade left `package-lock.json` out of sync with `package.json`, which broke `npm ci` in site test workflows. This release ships a regenerated, matching pair, and the v1.6.2 migration re-applies both together on upgrade.
- **Framework tests no longer run on user sites.** A guard that keeps Telar's own test suite from running on user sites was dropped in v1.5.0, causing spurious test-failure emails whenever dependabot opened a pull request on a user site. The guard is restored.
- **No more duplicate upgrade issues.** Re-running the "Upgrade Telar" workflow no longer files a second upgrade issue alongside an existing open one for the same version.

### Removed

- **`.github/dependabot.yml`.** Dependency updates are managed through the Telar release process, not per-site. The file is removed from the template and, via the v1.6.2 migration, from existing user sites. Repository-level GitHub security alerts are unaffected.

### Notes

- Migration script `scripts/migrations/v161_to_v162.py` upgrades automatically from v1.6.1 (and chains through from earlier versions). Two manual steps: recopying `.github/workflows/upgrade.yml` from the template is recommended but not urgent, since `upgrade.py` now self-installs its dependencies regardless; recopying `.github/workflows/telar-tests.yml` stops Telar's framework tests from running on your site. The `dependabot.yml` removal is informational only.
- New consistency tests run in Telar's own CI on every pull request to catch this class of workflow/dependency mismatch before it ships again.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-11

Upgrade-tooling fix release. The v1.6.0 upgrade could not actually be applied: the upgrade script never registered the v1.6.0 migration, so direct upgrade runs stopped at v1.5.4 while reporting success — and the release was missing the verified tooling package the "Upgrade Telar" workflow downloads, so workflow runs failed before making any changes. Both are fixed; upgrading to v1.6.1 applies everything v1.6.0 contained. No site content, configuration, or display changes.

### Fixed

- **Upgrade chain repaired.** `scripts/upgrade.py` now registers the v1.5.4 → v1.6.0 migration (the migration itself shipped with v1.6.0 but was never wired in) and the new v1.6.0 → v1.6.1 step. Upgrades from any earlier version now run through to v1.6.1 and stamp the version they actually installed.
- **Verified tooling package published.** The `telar-scripts-v1.6.1.tar.gz` release asset and its checksum, which the "Upgrade Telar" workflow requires since v1.5.0, ship with this release (v1.6.0 shipped without them, so the workflow failed closed before touching any site).

### Notes

- If an upgrade run reported success but left your site at v1.5.4, run the upgrade again — the chain now continues through to v1.6.1. If the "Upgrade Telar" workflow failed with a download error, that was this bug.
- No site was ever left broken or half-upgraded: the workflow path failed before starting, and the direct path completed a valid upgrade to v1.5.4.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-10

Code health release. Housekeeping across the whole framework — verified dead-code removal, consolidation of duplicated logic, honest labelling of generated vs source files — plus a rebuilt private-stories pipeline, a localization sweep, and a long tail of fixes. Framework files and language packs upgrade automatically; one manual step is required for sites that use private stories (see Notes).

### Changed

- **Private stories rebuilt.** Encryption now happens after the site is built, from the fully rendered page: unlocked stories render glossary links, LaTeX, and localized errors exactly like open stories. The build scans its own output for private content before publishing, and a site with private stories and an outdated build workflow fails on purpose rather than publishing unprotected.
- **Localization sweep.** Interface text that was hardcoded in English now follows the site language (media-type labels, audio controls, story chrome, glossary headings, panel errors, carousel controls, degraded-mode navigation, upgrade alerts, embed banner fallback); pipeline warnings and the upgrade summary are generated in the site's language.
- **Theme colours where they belong.** Headings, glossary letters, filter toggles, and panel blockquotes follow the active theme; DEMO labels use the brand colour; the accordion focus ring is visible again.
- **Code health.** Over 750 lines of verified dead code removed; duplicated logic consolidated to single homes (media-type lists, SCSS mixins, pipeline helpers, IIIF thumbnail resolution, object-page theme/video logic, KaTeX configuration); generated files carry generated-file banners and are marked linguist-generated; comments state constraints instead of narrating history. No reader-facing changes.

### Fixed

- Alt text from the objects CSV now reaches object pages and story steps (from Ana María Cárdenas Gasca's fix).
- Audio clips honour `clip_start` on first play, not only after looping.
- LaTeX in a step's question or answer (without layer text) now loads the renderer.
- Local tile generation without libvips produces tiles the viewer can actually request; the generator names its backend and recommends libvips.
- The objects page no longer makes doomed image-server requests for video/audio objects; thumbnail resolution is hardened across IIIF profile variants.
- Panels: no instance leak on reopen, state stays in sync on outside dismissal, close icon shows in vertical/embed layouts.
- Embedded stories use the site-wide 1024px responsive boundary; button navigation starts from the intro card; uppercase audio extensions recognised; palette-transparency images composite onto white; a text step without coordinates shows the full object; title-card text renders as plain text per its contract.

### Notes

- **Manual step for private-story sites:** v1.6.0's build workflow adds the encryption step, and GitHub does not allow automated upgrades to modify workflow files — recopy `build.yml` from the template (the Compositor does this automatically). Until then, marking a story `private: yes` fails the build by design. See the release notes for details.
- Language packs are replaced wholesale on upgrade, as in previous releases — re-apply customisations.
- Known issues: two long-standing story-engine behaviours (a card briefly lingering over the title after "Back to Start"; the URL step fragment not updating during ordinary scrolling) ship documented, to be fixed at the root by a planned story-engine restructure.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-29

CI/build fix release. Adds a GitHub Pages concurrency group to the build workflow so rapid successive builds of the same repository no longer race on Pages' one-deployment-per-repo limit. CI only — no content, schema, or configuration changes. Upgrade in place or simply redeploy.

### Fixed

- **Spurious "build failed" emails on rapid successive builds.** GitHub Pages allows only one in-progress deployment per repository, so when several builds started within the same second (for example, when a new site is created and multiple commits plus a manual run land together) the losing runs failed their "Deploy to GitHub Pages" step and emailed the owner, even though the site deployed correctly. Build runs are now grouped per branch with a `concurrency` setting and superseded runs are cancelled, so the newest build wins cleanly with no failure noise.

### Notes

- The only changed framework file is `.github/workflows/build.yml`. The Telar Compositor updates it automatically on upgrade; sites upgrading via the "Upgrade Telar" Actions workflow or locally must add the `concurrency` block by hand, since GitHub does not allow automated upgrades to modify workflow files (see the release notes for the exact snippet).

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-23

Internationalization fix release. Built-in interface text that still showed in English on Spanish-language sites (`telar_language: es`) now follows the site language. Display only — no content, schema, or configuration changes. Upgrade in place or simply redeploy.

### Fixed

- **Interface text now follows the site language.** Several built-in strings were hardcoded in English and stayed untranslated on Spanish sites: the "Back to Collection" and "Back to Glossary" links, the coordinate tool button with its Copy X / Y / Zoom and copy-manifest tooltips, the "Image Viewer Unavailable" alerts, the Google Sheets and theme configuration-error banners, the thumbnail "Loading..." placeholders, and the footer credit line. They now read from the language pack and follow `telar_language`.
- **Objects and glossary headings now translated.** The objects and glossary page headings, and the Medium/Genre and media-type filter labels on the objects page, now follow the site language instead of showing in English.
- **Duplicate browser-tab title on translated pages.** Translated pages emitted two `<title>` tags, and the second (added by the SEO plugin) was always English. Each page now has a single, language-aware title. The home, objects, and glossary browser-tab titles follow the site language through a new optional `title_key` field (see Migration).

### Changed

- **Objects page wording (English sites).** The objects page now takes its heading and browser-tab title from the language pack: the browser-tab title reads "Objects" (was "Objects in the Stories") and the page heading reads "See the objects behind the stories". Spanish sites already used these strings.

### Notes

- Social-share preview titles (`og:title` / `twitter:title`) still come from the static English page title and remain English on translated sites. The SEO plugin binds them to page front matter and cannot suppress just the social title; this is a known, separate limitation.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-13

Small fix release for the validation warning banners. Display only — no content changes and no manual steps. Upgrade in place or simply redeploy.

### Fixed

- **Glossary warning message.** When a story references a glossary term that doesn't exist, the warning showed a literal `{{ file_path }}` placeholder and pointed only to `telar-content/texts/glossary/`. It now names the missing term cleanly and points to your glossary spreadsheet as well as the markdown folder.
- **Story banner heading shown twice.** The warning banner on a story's intro card repeated the same line as both its heading and its description; it now has a proper heading.
- **Homepage warning banners now translated.** The "Object configuration issues detected" and "Story configuration issues detected" banners on the homepage (headings and the "Navigate to ... to see more details." line) were hardcoded in English; they now follow the site language.

### Dependencies

- Routine dependency updates: `lenis`, `esbuild`, `vitest`, `@vimeo/player` (npm); `cryptography`, `jinja2`, `pillow-heif`, `playwright`, `pyyaml` (Python); `ruby/setup-ruby` (CI). No behavior change.

### Notes

- The README version badge had lagged at 1.4.0 through the last two releases; it is now correct.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-10

Small fix release for glossary auto-linking. The `[[term]]` syntax now works in story step texts, and glossary terms match regardless of letter case. Runtime and tooling only — no content changes and no migration. Upgrade in place or simply redeploy.

### Fixed

- **Glossary links in story step texts.** Writing `[[term]]` in a story step's answer text now creates a glossary link, just as it already did inside layer panels. Previously the brackets published as plain text. The question line is a heading and is intentionally left as plain text.
- **Case-insensitive glossary terms.** `[[Term]]`, `[[term]]`, and `[[TERM]]` now all resolve to the same glossary entry, matching whatever id the glossary defines (so an acronym written `[[IIIF]]` links correctly). The link points at the glossary entry's own page regardless of how the term was typed.

### Notes

- In password-protected stories, a `[[term]]` in the step text shows as plain text (the term's name) rather than a clickable link. Glossary links inside layer panels still work in protected stories. (Inline glossary links in the step texts of protected stories may come in a later release.)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-06

Robustness and security release. Runtime and tooling only — no content changes; existing stories, objects, and configuration continue to work unchanged. This release hardens the build pipeline, the story viewer, and the automatic upgrade workflow, adds defensive input handling and output escaping throughout, and removes the last third-party CDN dependency by vendoring the audio waveform library. The automatic upgrade applies everything except two manual steps (see Migration).

### Security

- **Output escaping throughout.** Author-supplied content (titles, alt text, captions, questions and answers, glossary terms, image attributes) is now escaped at every render sink, in both the Python build and the JavaScript runtime. Jinja2 autoescaping is enabled for widget rendering.
- **TLS certificate verification restored** on all Google Sheets and IIIF manifest fetches (verification had been disabled).
- **Protected (password-locked) stories.** The build now fails closed if a protected story cannot be encrypted, instead of shipping it as plaintext; PBKDF2 iterations raised from 100,000 to 210,000; encrypted stories no longer expose byline, description, or SEO metadata; the in-browser unlock cache no longer stores decrypted content.
- **Hardened automatic upgrade workflow.** It now downloads its tooling as a checksum-verified release asset and runs it in isolation, refusing to run unverified code. The target-version input is validated and passed safely.
- **KaTeX math rendering** is constrained to safe links only.
- **Path-traversal guards** on object IDs and story layer filenames, and size caps on all remote reads (Sheets, demo bundle, PDFs, IIIF).

### Changed

- **Audio waveform library vendored.** WaveSurfer is now served from your own site instead of a CDN, so audio stories and audio object pages work offline and carry no third-party runtime dependency.
- **Upgrade engine.** Framework files are now installed atomically (all-or-nothing with backup and restore), and migrations are chained strictly, failing closed on any error.
- **Dependency floors raised.** Minimum versions bumped for `pandas` (3.0.3), `markdown` (3.10.2), and `cryptography` (48.0.0), plus the test tools `pytest` (9.0.3) and `pytest-cov` (7.1.0). Sites upgrading in place are unaffected — the framework fixes use the standard library — so the new floors apply to fresh installs and the project's own CI.

### Fixed

- **IIIF viewer plate visibility.** The image plate now stays visible when navigating between steps that share the same object, and same-object focal interpolation uses the correct step list.
- **Story panels.** Closing a panel is handled consistently (no double-close), and opening a layer panel correctly dismisses an already-open panel.
- **Deep links.** Panel-open timers are cancelled if the reader navigates during load, so a panel no longer pops open over a different step.
- **YouTube and Google Drive video sizing.** Non-16:9 videos are now sized to their true aspect (or given an intentional dark letterbox frame) instead of floating in the page background.
- **Audio and scroll-engine lifecycle.** Resolved assorted race conditions and re-initialization issues.
- **Theme button text.** Restored the button-text color fix (carried from a v1.4.0 hotfix that missed the v1.4.0 tag) so themed buttons no longer render with invisible text.
- **Story step order.** Steps now render in the order of their `step` number rather than the spreadsheet's saved row order, so a story whose rows ended up out of sequence still displays correctly. Falls back safely to the saved order if step values are missing or non-numeric.

### Migration

- The automatic upgrade applies all of the above. Two manual steps remain, listed in your `UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` after upgrading:
  1. Update your two GitHub Actions workflow files (`upgrade.yml`, `build.yml`) by hand — GitHub does not allow the automated upgrade to modify workflow files. Your site keeps building if you skip this; the changes only harden your workflows.
  2. Re-apply any customizations to the language packs (`en.yml` / `es.yml`), which were refreshed with the new protected-story sharing warnings.
- No content changes: no CSV schema, story-step, or `_config.yml` key changes.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-26

Runtime upgrade with no content changes required. Existing stories, objects, and configuration continue to work unchanged. This release replaces the Tify viewer with a custom, self-hosted OpenSeadragon wrapper and rebuilds the responsive system around a single source of truth, fixing cross-device IIIF centering.

### Fixed

- **Cross-device IIIF centering**: Rewrote the focal-point algorithm using a two-circle model that derives a device-independent focal radius from the authoring aspect ratio and reads the measured text-card rectangle. Fixes focal points landing off-target across viewport widths, high-zoom near-bottom clipping, iPad portrait Y pinning, horizontal drift under zoom, and a low baseline. Verified on iPhone and iPad portrait via iOS Simulator and a 12-cell device matrix.

- **Deep-link and in-story navigation jump**: `navigateToStep()` and `applyDeepLinkOnLoad()` previously used a manual scroll poke that left the scroll engine in a stale state, freezing the IIIF viewer at a partially-interpolated zoom. Both now use a forced immediate scroll with snap-index sync, giving a deterministic jump to the authored position.

- **iOS Safari URL-bar layout jump**: All layout-affecting heights now use `dvh` with a `vh` fallback via `@supports`. Eliminates the reflow that occurred when the Safari URL bar showed or hid on scroll.

- **Notch safe-area clearance**: Applied `env(safe-area-inset-*)` at the credits badge, mobile navigation buttons, and mobile text card using the `max(<offset>, env(...))` idiom.

- **Hover styles on touch devices**: All `:hover` rules are now wrapped in `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`, so touch devices no longer show sticky hover states.

- **Reduced-motion compliance**: Smooth scrolling is disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set, and IIIF pan/zoom animations apply immediately under the same preference.

### Added

- **Custom IIIF viewer**: New `assets/js/telar-story/iiif-viewer.js` and `iiif-manifest.js` wrap OpenSeadragon and parse IIIF Presentation API v2 and v3 manifests, supporting multi-page manifests, a pagination chrome for multi-page objects, and an error fallback UI. Scroll-to-zoom and click-to-zoom stay under Telar's scroll-engine control on story plates; object pages opt in to zoom gestures.

- **`layout-mode.js` — responsive runtime module**: Replaces the binary `state.isMobileViewport` flag with a `state.layoutMode` abstraction (`'horizontal'` / `'vertical'`). Owns the single `resize`/`orientationchange` listener in the runtime and reads breakpoints from CSS custom properties so JS and CSS cannot drift.

- **`--telar-*` CSS custom properties**: `_sass/_responsive.scss` is now the single source of truth for layout-affecting constants (breakpoints, card geometry, density tiers, audio/video scaling factors), mirrored to `--telar-*` properties on `:root` for JS to read via `getComputedStyle`.

- **Container queries on `.text-card`**: `container-type: inline-size` added; font size, padding, gap, and line height inside the card now scale off the card's own width.

- **Six `object.viewer.*` language keys** in `en.yml` and `es.yml` (`prev_page`, `next_page`, `page_input_label`, `page_input_aria`, `image_unavailable_title`, `image_unavailable_detail`) for the IIIF viewer chrome and error UI.

### Changed

- **Cascade layer order**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 is now loaded inside a `@layer` cascade layer, so Telar's own rules take precedence without `!important`. Over 150 Bootstrap-fight `!important` declarations removed across `_sass/`.

- **Breakpoints recalibrated**: the vertical layout now activates at widths narrower than 1024px or aspect ratios narrower than 3:4, covering tablets in portrait as well as phones.

- **Height-tier blocks consolidated**: nine `@media (max-height: ...)` blocks across the stylesheets collapsed into one block in `_sass/_responsive.scss`.

- **Vendored OpenSeadragon 6.0.2**: `assets/vendor/openseadragon.min.js` (337 KB) replaces the Tify CDN load. Source and SHA-256 digest are recorded in `assets/vendor/README.md`.

### Removed

- **Tify IIIF viewer and Vue dependency**: removed the Tify CDN stylesheet and module imports from `_layouts/story.html` and `_layouts/object.html`, along with the 56 `!important` declarations in `_sass/_viewer.scss` that existed solely to hide Tify's UI chrome. Tify's ~529 KB CDN payload (469 KB JS + 60 KB CSS) gives way to a 337 KB vendored OpenSeadragon — about 190 KB less viewer code, served locally with no CDN dependency.

- **`state.isMobileViewport`**: replaced by `state.layoutMode`.

- **Stale bundle files**: `assets/js/telar-story.bundle.js` and `assets/js/telar-story-bundle.js` deleted (unreferenced leftovers from an earlier build naming scheme).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-10

i18n hygiene plus a new sister-file localization convention. Wires up Telar's existing language packs in places that previously hardcoded English, introduces a sister-file convention for localizing user pages, and refreshes the demo content to reflect current capabilities (multimedia, Telar Compositor, dual storytelling/collections framing).

### Fixed

- **Homepage headings rendered in English for Spanish users**: `_layouts/index.html` now resolves the stories and objects headings via `page.X | default: lang.pages.X | default: "<English literal>"`. Previously the layout dropped straight to the English literal when no `page.*` override was set, and the template's `index.md` shipped with English page-overrides that shadowed the i18n for every existing user with `telar_language: es`

- **Empty-state messages and IIIF URL warning hardcoded in English**: `_layouts/index.html`, `_layouts/objects-index.html`, `_layouts/glossary-index.html`, and `_includes/iiif-url-warning.html` now reference `lang.empty_states.*` and `lang.errors.iiif_mismatch.*` keys that were already defined in both language files but never used. Spanish-language sites now show empty-state guidance and the IIIF mismatch troubleshooting modal in Spanish

- **JS thumbnail fallback strings hardcoded in English**: `_layouts/index.html` and `_layouts/objects-index.html` now inject `TelarI18n` and `TelarI18nIIIF` constants from the lang values, so the "Failed to load" and "No image" placeholders displayed when a thumbnail fails appear in the site's active language

- **Empty-state messages pointed at the wrong content directory**: empty-state guidance previously told users to add story/object/glossary files to `_stories/`, `_objects/`, or `_glossary/`. Those directories are auto-generated; the canonical user-content paths are under `telar-content/spreadsheets/` and `telar-content/texts/glossary/`. The lang values had the correct paths; wiring them up fixed both the i18n bug and the misleading guidance

- **Migration script language detection for Spanish sites**: `BaseMigration._detect_language()` was looking for `telar_language` nested under the `telar:` block in `_config.yml`, but the key has always been a top-level key. Every Spanish-language site fell through to the English default for migration manual steps. The base class now reads the correct top-level key, so Spanish sites now get the Spanish-language manual steps in `UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` and (in v1.3.0 specifically) the conditional `acerca.md` creation guard sees the correct language

### Added

- **Sister-file localization for user pages** (`telar-content/texts/pages/`): `scripts/generate_collections.py` now detects markdown files with frontmatter `localized_for: <canonical>.md` and `language: <code>`. When `site.telar_language` matches the sister's `language`, the build uses the sister's content but writes output under the canonical filename — so `/about/` resolves to the right language without URL duplication. The v1.3.0 template ships with `acerca.md` as the Spanish sister of `about.md`; users can add siblings for other languages following the same convention

- **`lang.index_page.welcome`** key carrying the homepage welcome content as a multi-line markdown block scalar in both EN and ES. The default `index.md` body now renders `{{ lang.index_page.welcome | markdownify }}` with a bilingual EN/ES override comment explaining how site owners replace it with their own content

- **`lang.pages.glossary_intro`** key for the glossary page intro sentence, paired with EN and ES values. `pages/glossary.md` body now references this key

- **`lang.errors.iiif_mismatch.local_fix_check_config`** and **`local_fix_run_with_note`**: two missing keys completing the IIIF URL warning's local-development fallback section

- **Migration script `v121_to_v130.py` and matching `migration.json` manifest**: conditional content cleanup that removes the three stale `index.md` frontmatter keys and replaces user-content bodies (welcome, glossary, objects, about) with the v1.3.0 lang-key templates only when a SHA-256 hash check confirms the file is byte-for-byte identical to the v1.2.1 default. Any user customisation preserves the file untouched. For sites with `telar_language: es` whose `about.md` is unchanged from the v1.2.1 default, the migration also creates `acerca.md` automatically so the site immediately renders Spanish content at `/about/`. Sites with a customised `about.md` skip this — otherwise the new sister file would shadow the customisation

### Changed

- **Default content of welcome and about pages refreshed** to reflect current Telar capabilities. Both now name both Telar modes (digital storytelling and publishing small digital collections), name multimedia coverage (IIIF images, video, audio, narrative text, contextual layers), present the three setup paths (Telar Compositor, GitHub template + Sheets, hands-on local), and link to the Telar Compositor. Previous content described Telar as it was around v0.7 (single-mode storytelling, GitHub template only, no audio/video, no Compositor)

- **`pages/glossary.md`, `pages/objects.md`, `index.md`** rewritten to render via lang keys rather than hardcoded English. Each file carries a bilingual EN/ES HTML override comment explaining how to replace the default with custom content. The pattern uses `{% assign lang = site.data.languages[site.telar_language] | default: site.data.languages.en %}` at the top of the page (the layout's own `lang` assignment isn't visible to the page body, which Jekyll renders before wrapping in the layout)

- **`telar-content/texts/pages/about.md`** rewritten with the refreshed copy plus a sentence in the Customize alert documenting the sister-file convention for site owners adding additional languages

### Removed

- **Stale `lang.pages.home_title` key** from both `en.yml` and `es.yml`. Defined since v1.0.0-beta but never referenced from any layout, include, or script

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-08

Patch release with a demo content fetch fix and project metadata additions.

### Fixed

- **Demo content fetch tolerates v-prefixed `telar.version`**: `scripts/fetch_demo_content.py` previously raised `ValueError` internally when `_config.yml` had a v-prefixed version string (e.g. `version: "v1.2.0"`) and silently built sites with no demo content. An earlier version of the Telar Compositor's upgrade flow wrote v-prefixed strings into some sites; the compositor was fixed, but historical bad values persisted in upgraded sites. The fetcher now strips a leading `v` (or `V`) when reading the version and again as defence-in-depth when parsing entries from the remote `versions.json` index. A new warning surfaces in the build log if a site version cannot be parsed for any other reason. Sites with stale v-prefixed values continue to work; the value can optionally be cleaned up to a bare numeric version

### Added

- **`CITATION.cff`** with author and ORCID metadata for academic citation
- **Migration script `v120_to_v121.py`** and matching `migration.json` manifest for the demo content fetch fix

### Changed

- **Expanded `package.json` metadata** (`version`, `description`, `license`, `author`, `contributors`, `homepage`, `repository`, `bugs`) for clarity in the npm/GitHub ecosystem

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-16

Story structure and UX improvements.

### Added

- **Section card table of contents**: Stories with `show_sections: yes` in project.csv display a navigable TOC on the title card, listing every section card as a clickable link. The title card uses the layer 2 panel background color when TOC is enabled. Add `mostrar_secciones: si` for Spanish-language sites

- **Back to Start button**: The "Back to Home" button in the top-left corner now switches to "Back to Start" once readers scroll past the title card. Clicking it returns to the title card. On mobile, the button shows a contextual icon (home or up-arrow)

- **In-story navigation**: New `navigateToStep()` and `navigateToIntro()` functions allow jumping between steps from within the story, used by the TOC links and the Back to Start button

- **Migration manifest**: Each release now includes a machine-readable `migration.json` describing content transforms, attached as a GitHub Release asset. The Telar Compositor uses these manifests to upgrade sites through its web interface

### Changed

- **Story card placeholders**: Homepage thumbnails now show the first letter of the story title instead of an auto-generated ordinal number. Related story links on object pages show the title only

### Fixed

- **Deep link parent panel stacking**: Deep links to layer 2 panels (e.g. `#s3l2`) now correctly open layer 1 underneath, so all parent panels are visible when arriving via a shared link

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-12

Structural and navigational features for richer storytelling.

### Added

- **Deep linking**: Share URLs that point to a specific step in a story, optionally with a panel layer open. The URL fragment updates silently as the reader scrolls, and shared links open directly at the right position

- **Title cards**: Chapter heading cards that appear between story steps. Mark a step row with an empty object to create a title card — it displays styled heading text without a media viewer and participates fully in scroll, keyboard, and button navigation

- **Collection mode**: Set `collection_mode: true` in `_config.yml` to flip the homepage to a collection-first layout with large object thumbnails and stories below. Default mode is unchanged

- **Bibliography styling**: Use the `:::bibliography` widget block in panel markdown content to format references with hanging indent (first line flush, subsequent lines indented)

- **Share panel "this view" tab**: The share panel now includes a tab that copies the current URL with the reader's exact position

### Fixed

- **Panel scroll**: Wheel events inside open panels are no longer intercepted by the scroll engine. Users can scroll panel content freely without the story advancing

- **Keyboard navigation in panels**: Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, and Spacebar now scroll panel content when a panel is open, instead of navigating story steps

- **Video/audio not paused on title cards**: Media players now properly deactivate when scrolling from a video or audio card into a title card, in both directions

- **IIIF viewer background on object pages**: The Telar weave pattern now shows correctly behind the IIIF viewer on object pages, instead of Tify's default grey dot grid

- **Audio object detection**: Audio objects are now correctly detected even without the `audiowaveform` system dependency, via a new audio manifest generated during the CSV-to-JSON pipeline

- **ArrowRight on first step**: Fixed an issue where pressing ArrowRight immediately after arriving at step 1 from the intro could fail because the scroll animation briefly reset the step index

### Changed

- **Panel DOM attributes**: All panels now carry a `data-telar-panel` attribute for consistent selector targeting

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-03-25

A new milestone.

This is Telar's twenty-fourth release. For the first time, Telar can weave together images, video, and audio — a major new stage that we hope will help you tell all sorts of new stories. Together with a fluid scroll engine (no more jumping!), a new card-stack architecture, and the WYSIWYG [Telar Compositor](https://compositor.telar.org), these features round out the roadmap we first sketched when we started building Telar. It finally feels like a 1.0.

None of this would have happened without all of you who tested early versions, reported what was broken, and told us what you needed. Thank you.

— Juan

### Added

- **Video support**: YouTube, Vimeo, and Google Drive videos in stories and on object pages. Clip control (start, end, loop) lets you highlight specific segments

- **Audio support**: Audio files with WaveSurfer waveform visualization in stories and on object pages. Clip regions for selecting segments

- **Clip time picker**: Interactive tool on object pages for setting video and audio clip boundaries. Copy start/end times directly into your spreadsheet

- **Card-stack scroll architecture**: Stories now use a continuous scroll model with magnetic waypoints instead of the previous step-by-step navigation. Cards slide over previous ones, creating a fluid reading experience

- **Media type detection and filtering**: Objects are automatically classified as Image, Video, or Audio. The gallery page has separate type and medium filters

- **Alt text support**: New `alt_text` column in story and object spreadsheets for accessibility descriptions, with automatic fallback to object titles

- **Inline Lucide SVG icons**: All icons are now self-hosted inline SVGs, replacing the Google Material Symbols and Bootstrap Icons CDN dependencies

- **Audio build pipeline**: New `process_audio.py` script for clip extraction and waveform peak data generation, integrated into the local build script and GitHub Actions workflow

### Changed

- **Scroll system**: Replaced the discrete step accumulator with Lenis continuous scroll and magnetic snap waypoints

- **Card rendering**: New per-scene card pool with z-index banding replaces the previous split-column viewer/narrative layout

- **Mobile layout**: Text cards are bottom-anchored on mobile with frosted glass styling

- **Object pages**: Media-type-conditional rendering — images get the IIIF viewer with coordinate panel, videos get embeds with clip picker, audio gets waveform with region-based clip picker

- **Gallery**: Video and audio objects show icon placeholders. Two separate filter sections (Type and Medium/Genre)

- **Viewer preloading**: `max_viewer_cards` default reduced from 10 to 8

### Removed

- **Google Material Symbols CDN dependency**: Replaced by inline Lucide SVGs
- **Bootstrap Icons CDN dependency**: Replaced by inline Lucide SVGs

## [0.9.4-beta] - 2026-03-18

PDF dependency fix.

### Fixed

- **PDF IIIF tile generation in CI**: PyMuPDF was not listed in `requirements.txt`, so CI skipped IIIF tile generation for PDF objects entirely. PDF objects now get tiles generated correctly during builds

## [0.9.3-beta] - 2026-03-14

IIIF bug fixes, multi-page story improvements, and coordinate panel restyle.

### Fixed

- **IIIF crash for small images**: Images smaller than 512px (the tile size) produced an empty `scaleFactors` array in `info.json`, crashing OpenSeadragon/Tify with a `RangeError`. Now defaults to `[1]`

- **IIIF edge tile 404s**: Images larger than 1024px showed 404 errors for edge tiles. The `sizes` array had a single full-resolution entry that caused OpenSeadragon to miscalculate edge tile dimensions

- **IIIF thumbnail generation**: Thumbnails for all scaleFactor levels are now pre-rendered during IIIF generation, and width-only directories from libvips get `{w},{h}` counterparts. Fixes broken homepage and gallery thumbnails

- **Story page switching for multi-page objects**: Navigating between story steps that reference different pages of the same object (e.g. different PDF pages) now correctly loads the new page instead of staying on the original

- **Coordinate finder column order**: Multi-page coordinate copy buttons now output `x,y,zoom,page` to match the spreadsheet column order (was `page,x,y,zoom`)

- **Page column case normalisation**: The `Page` column from Google Sheets (capital P) is now normalised to `page` (lowercase), fixing PDF page-specific manifest loading in stories

- **Page selector truncation**: Fixed Tify 0.35 page selector text being cut off by targeting the renamed `.tify-dropdown-button` class

- **Coordinate panel heading colour**: The panel heading is now explicitly coloured in dark/light variants, overriding the global heading colour rule that made it unreadable on dark theme backgrounds

### Changed

- **Object viewer orientation**: Changed from landscape (fixed 600px height) to portrait (4:5 aspect ratio) on object pages

- **Coordinate panel styling**: Replaced 50+ inline styles with a new SCSS partial (`_coordinate-panel.scss`) using theme-aware colours via CSS custom properties and WCAG luminance detection

- **Coordinate panel internationalisation**: Instructions now use language keys instead of hardcoded English, with a multi-page variant that mentions the Page value

- **Thumbnail size selection**: Homepage and objects gallery now pick the smallest IIIF size >= 400px wide for thumbnails, instead of blindly using the smallest available size

## [0.9.2-beta] - 2026-03-06

IIIF tile rendering fix and workflow cleanup. Thanks to Ashley Vazquez for reporting the Windows rendering issue.

### Fixed

- **IIIF tile rendering on Windows**: Fixed incomplete `sizes` array in `info.json` that caused OpenSeadragon to miscalculate zoom levels and request tiles with negative region coordinates. The `patch_info_json()` function now scans both `w,h` and `w,` (width-only) thumbnail directories generated by libvips. Thanks to Ashley Vazquez for catching this!

- **TIFY 96px thumbnail**: Generate `full/96,/0/default.jpg` thumbnail that TIFY v0.35 hardcodes for its page navigator panel, regardless of IIIF profile level. Previously 404'd on static Level 0 hosting

### Changed

- **Test workflow scoped to main repos**: The Test Telar Scripts workflow now only runs on `UCSB-AMPLab/telar` and `juancobo/telar`, preventing unnecessary CI runs on user sites that inherit the workflow

## [0.9.1-beta] - 2026-03-05

LaTeX math rendering and a file extension bug fix. Thanks to Jaydon Schuler!

### Added

- **LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX)**: Automatic per-page LaTeX detection and rendering using KaTeX 0.16.21. Supports inline math (`$...$`), display math (`$$...$$`), and environments (`\begin{align}`, `\begin{equation}`, etc.). Detection uses smart heuristics to avoid false positives (e.g. `$50` does not trigger math rendering). LaTeX works in story panels, object descriptions, glossary definitions, and custom pages. Sites without LaTeX content have zero overhead -- KaTeX is only loaded on pages that need it

- **Encrypted story LaTeX support**: Stories protected with encryption now support LaTeX. KaTeX loads dynamically after decryption if the story content contains math notation

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive file extension matching**: Objects with uppercase extensions (e.g. `image.JPG`, `photo.PNG`) no longer trigger false "file missing" warnings during the build or on the site. Extension comparison now uses case-insensitive matching when scanning the objects directory

## [0.9.0-beta] - 2026-03-03

Faster builds, simpler setup, and multi-page document support.

### Added

- **libvips IIIF tile generation**: 28x faster tile generation using libvips as the preferred backend (`vips dzsave --layout iiif3`). Falls back automatically to the Python `iiif` library if the `vips` CLI is not available. GitHub Actions workflow installs `libvips-tools` automatically

- **Tify viewer**: Replaced UniversalViewer with Tify (v0.35.0) across all viewer contexts. Tify uses fewer DOM nodes, provides a Promise-based readiness API, and exposes the OpenSeadragon viewer through a documented public property. All existing viewport coordinates remain compatible

- **PDF document support**: PDF files placed in `telar-content/objects/` are rendered into multi-page IIIF tile pyramids with per-page single-canvas manifests. Requires PyMuPDF (`pip install pymupdf`)

- **Multi-page IIIF support**: Story steps can reference specific pages of multi-page objects using a new `page` column in the story CSV. The coordinate picker on object pages detects multi-page objects, shows pagination controls, and includes the page number in copied coordinates

- **Custom metadata fields**: Extra columns in `objects.csv` beyond the standard fields are now passed through to object pages and rendered in the metadata section. Labels check language keys first, then fall back to the column name with underscores replaced by spaces

- **Trama theme**: New default theme featuring Telar's new visual identity, by Adelaida Ávila. Terracotta links and buttons, lavender layer backgrounds, Space Grotesk headings, Roboto Condensed body text. The Paisajes theme remains available and existing sites keep their configured theme

### Changed

- **Content folder restructure**: `components/` renamed to `telar-content/`, with `images/` renamed to `objects/` (now holds images and PDFs) and `structures/` renamed to `spreadsheets/`. The `telar-` prefix makes the user content directory clearly identifiable. Migration script handles the rename automatically

- **Single Google Sheets URL**: Simplified from requiring both a shared URL and a published URL to using only the published URL. Users no longer need to "Share with link" -- only "Publish to web". If `shared_url` is still present in `_config.yml`, it is silently ignored

## [0.8.1-beta] - 2026-02-26

Onboarding and demo content release with documentation restructure, template simplification, and Spanish-language spreadsheet support.

### Added

- **Spanish-language spreadsheet support**: Google Sheets tabs named `glosario` are now recognized and routed correctly alongside `glossary`. The `instrucciones` tab is also properly skipped during fetch

- **Updated demo content**: Demo bundles now include v0.8.0 metadata fields (year, object_type, subjects, featured, source) so demo objects appear correctly in the gallery filter system

### Changed

- **Google Sheets template simplified**: Reduced from 8 tabs to 6 by removing example story tabs. Users now duplicate `blank_template` / `plantilla_en_blanco` to create new stories

- **Demo object merging**: The demo content system now handles both v0.6.0 bundles (with `medium`, `dimensions`, `location`) and v0.8.0+ bundles (with `year`, `object_type`, `subjects`, `featured`, `source`)

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2026-02-05

Content and access release adding story protection, an enhanced gallery system, and glossary CSV support.

### Added

- **Protected stories**: Stories can now be encrypted with a site-wide key. Add `protected=yes` to a story's row in `project.csv` and set `story_key` in `_config.yml`. Protected stories are encrypted at build time using AES-256-GCM and decrypted in the browser when viewers enter the key. An unlock overlay with session persistence means the key only needs to be entered once per browser session. Share links can optionally include the key for convenient access

- **Browse and search for objects**: The objects page now includes a filter sidebar, full-text search (powered by Lunr.js), and sort controls. Filters use OR within a category and AND across categories. Desktop shows a 250px sidebar on the right; mobile shows a collapsible "Filter by" pill. Disable with `browse_and_search: false` in `_config.yml`

- **Featured objects on homepage**: Optionally display a sample of objects on the homepage with smaller 170px cards. Configure with `show_sample_on_homepage: true` and `featured_count` in `_config.yml`. Objects can be explicitly marked with a `featured` column in `objects.csv`, or selected randomly at build time

- **Glossary CSV support**: Define glossary terms in `components/structures/glossary.csv` as an alternative to individual markdown files. Supports inline definitions and file references. Existing markdown glossaries continue to work unchanged

- **Share panel redesign**: The share panel now uses pill-style tabs ("this story" / "this whole site") with inline copy buttons. For protected stories, a privacy toggle lets you choose whether to include the key in shared links and embed codes, with clear warnings about access implications

### Changed

- **Config setting renames**: `hide_stories` renamed to `skip_stories` and `hide_collections` renamed to `skip_collections` under `development-features`. Old names still work for backward compatibility

- **New config section**: `collection_interface` settings control the objects gallery (browse and search, homepage link, featured objects)

- **Object metadata fields**: Objects CSV now supports `year`, `object_type`, `subjects`, and `featured` columns for richer filtering. The `location` field has been renamed to `source` (old name still supported)

---

**Migration from v0.7.0-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- **Manual step required**: Copy updated `.github/workflows/build.yml` from the Telar repository (adds search data generation step)
- **For local development**: Install `cryptography` package: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2026-01-31

Infrastructure and code quality release focusing on maintainability, testing, and accessibility.

### Added

- **Test infrastructure**: Comprehensive automated testing with 305 tests across three frameworks. Python unit tests (235 tests) cover CSV processing, widget parsing, IIIF metadata extraction, and more. JavaScript unit tests (35 tests) verify viewer, navigation, and panel logic. End-to-end tests (35 tests) use Playwright to test story navigation, embed mode, and panel interactions in a real browser

- **Consolidated CI workflow**: Single `telar-tests.yml` workflow runs both Python and JavaScript tests on push/PR. Supports selective test runs via workflow dispatch for faster iteration

- **Dependabot**: Automatic security updates for GitHub Actions dependencies

### Changed

- **Modular Python scripts**: The 2,750-line `csv_to_json.py` is now a 14-module `telar/` package with clear separation of concerns. Each module has a focused purpose: `csv_utils.py` for CSV handling, `widgets.py` for widget parsing, `iiif_metadata.py` for IIIF extraction, etc. The original script remains as a backward-compatible wrapper

- **Modular JavaScript**: The 1,872-line `story.js` is now 6 ES modules bundled by esbuild. `state.js` centralises all mutable state, `navigation.js` handles all navigation modes, `viewer.js` manages IIIF viewer lifecycle, etc. Consolidated 135 lines of duplicated code into shared utilities

- **SCSS partials**: The 3,374-line `telar.scss` is now 9 focused partials in `_sass/`. Reusable mixins for tab colours and viewer hiding reduce duplication. Each partial has a narrative description explaining its purpose

- **Node.js required**: esbuild is now used to bundle JavaScript. Run `npm install` before building locally. The `build_local_site.py` script handles this automatically

### Fixed

- **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**: Fixed colour contrast on intro hints, added navigation landmark for home button, changed story container to semantic `<main>` element. Verified with axe-core accessibility audit

- **Navigation z-index**: Fixed intro step covering navigation buttons when scrolling back from later steps

- **Pandas 3.0 compatibility**: Fixed emoji sanitisation failing on pandas 3.0 due to StringDtype change

---

**Migration from v0.6.3-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- **Manual step required**: Copy updated GitHub Actions workflows from the Telar repository (build.yml, upgrade.yml, telar-tests.yml)
- **For local development**: Run `npm install` to install esbuild for JavaScript bundling

## [0.6.3-beta] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Inline panel content**: Write panel text directly in your spreadsheet instead of creating separate markdown files. Supports three methods: (1) entering text directly in cells, (2) pasting markdown text with optional YAML frontmatter, or (3) referencing external markdown files for complex content. The `layer1_file` column has been renamed to `layer1_content` (old name still works for backward compatibility)

### Changed

- **Column naming**: `layer1_file`, `layer2_file`, `layer3_file` renamed to `layer1_content`, `layer2_content`, `layer3_content` to reflect their expanded purpose. Spanish equivalents: `contenido_capa1`, `contenido_capa2`, `contenido_capa3`. Old column names remain supported for backward compatibility

### Fixed

- **Empty state messages**: Error messages now reference user-editable locations (spreadsheet, `components/` directory) instead of internal Jekyll directories

---

**Migration from v0.6.2-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- No breaking changes — existing spreadsheets and markdown files work without modification

## [0.6.2-beta] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Improved viewer preloading**: Complete overhaul of how Telar loads IIIF viewers eliminates black screens and speeds up navigation. All IIIF manifests are fetched in parallel when the story page loads, so images are ready before you scroll to them. Hovering over a story card on the homepage begins loading its manifests. A subtle shimmer animation shows when a viewer is initializing. Preloading behavior can be tuned via `development-features.viewer_preloading` in `_config.yml`

- **Glossary-to-glossary linking**: You can now use `[[term]]` syntax inside glossary definitions to link to other glossary terms

- **All-in-one build script for local sites**: New `build_local_site.py` runs the complete local build process with a single command. Use `--skip-iiif` for faster rebuilds when images haven't changed, `--skip-fetch` to skip demo content fetching. Serves on port 4001 by default

- **Development feature flags**: New `development-features` section in `_config.yml` with `hide_stories` (temporarily hide stories) and `hide_collections` (hide both objects and stories) for rapid testing

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive object references**: Object IDs in your story spreadsheet now match regardless of capitalization (e.g., `LEVIATHAN` finds `leviathan`)

- **Case-insensitive file paths**: Markdown file paths work regardless of case, preventing broken links when deploying from Mac to GitHub Pages

- **Index page image overflow**: Large images on the homepage no longer overflow their containers

- **Panel title spacing**: Improved spacing below panel titles for better readability

- **Panel title markup**: Panel titles now use proper `<h1>` elements for accessibility

### Removed

- **Sample glossary entries**: Removed placeholder glossary entries (colonial-period, reduccion, resguardo, viceroyalty, iiif-manifest, markdown) that were not used by the template stories

---

**Migration from v0.6.1-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- No breaking changes

## [0.6.1-beta] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **Bilingual README**: Framework README now includes both English and Spanish versions in a single file. Streamlined content removes duplication and directs users to comprehensive documentation at telar.org

### Fixed

- **EXIF orientation in thumbnails**: Fixed thumbnails displaying sideways/upside-down for smartphone photos with EXIF rotation metadata. The IIIF tile generator now correctly detects and applies all EXIF orientations (90°, 180°, 270°). Regenerate IIIF tiles to see correctly oriented thumbnails: `python3 scripts/generate_iiif.py`
- **Migration script template pollution**: Fixed v0.5.0→v0.6.0 migration adding unwanted template files to existing sites. The migration now only adds templates (`your-story/`, `tu-historia/`, demo glossary) to new sites without custom content

## [0.6.0-beta] - 2025-11-28

### Added

#### External Demo Content System
- **Demo content fetching**: New `include_demo_content` configuration option in `_config.yml` allows sites to optionally fetch versioned, multilingual demo content from content.telar.org
- **Automatic demo integration**: Demo stories and glossary entries are automatically merged with your content during the build process
- **Smart cleanup**: Template now ships without bundled demo content - fetch only when needed
- **Bilingual demos**: Demo content adapts to your site language (English or Spanish)
- **Version matching**: Fetches highest compatible demo version for your site

#### Custom Pages System
- **User-editable pages**: Create custom pages in `components/texts/pages/` directory (about, contact, etc.)
- **Configurable navigation menu**: Edit menu items via `_data/navigation.yml` with bilingual support
- **Full Telar features**: Widgets and glossary links work on custom pages
- **Responsive layout**: New `user-page.html` layout provides centered, mobile-friendly content

#### New Telar Website and Documentation

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: v0.4.0 Feature Restoration (Phase 1 - Data Pipeline)
- **Restored 1,382 lines** accidentally deleted from `csv_to_json.py` in commit f62acee (Nov 8, 2025)
- **Root cause**: Commit overwrote file, removing core v0.4.0 functionality
- **Features restored**:
  - Widget processing (~350 lines): accordion, carousel, tabs with Bootstrap HTML generation
  - IIIF metadata auto-population (~400 lines): extracts title, creator, period, location, credit
  - Glossary auto-linking (~150 lines): `[[term_id]]` syntax processing
  - Multilingual support (~100 lines): language string loading and interpolation
- **Applied v0.5.0 updates** to restored code (version header, flattened image paths)

---

## [0.4.2-beta] - 2025-11-09

### Added

#### Smart IIIF Change Detection
- **Automatic optimization**: Build workflow now intelligently detects when IIIF tile regeneration is needed
- **Git diff-based detection**: Compares changed files between commits to determine if images or objects.csv changed
- **Manual override**: Workflow dispatch includes "Force IIIF tile regeneration" checkbox (default: checked for safety)
- **Multiple failsafes**: Defaults to full build on first commit, detection errors, or uncertain cases
- **GitHub Actions caching**: IIIF tiles cached between builds to prevent deletion when skipping regeneration
- **Cache key strategy**: Automatically invalidates cache when image files change using hash-based keys
- **Time savings**: Faster deployments for content-only changes (stories, text, metadata)
- **User experience**: Silent optimization for automatic builds, explicit control for manual triggers

**How it works**:
- Automatic builds (push to main): Detects file changes, skips IIIF if only content changed
- Manual builds: User checkbox to skip IIIF regeneration (safe default always regenerates)
- Cache system: Tiles saved after generation, restored when skipping, automatically invalidated on image changes

**Technical details**:
- Detection step runs before IIIF generation
- Checks `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` for changed files
- Triggers IIIF when: images in `components/images/objects/` or `objects.csv` changed
- Skips IIIF when: Only content files changed (stories, glossary, configs, layouts, etc.)
- Cache operations: restore → generate (if needed) → save → restore to _site (if skipped)

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: IIIF Tile Deletion When Skipping Regeneration
- **Root cause identified**: GitHub Actions workflows are ephemeral - each run starts fresh with no IIIF tiles
- **Problem**: Skipping IIIF generation left `_site/iiif/objects/` empty, deployment replaced entire site, deleting live tiles
- **Solution**: GitHub Actions cache system preserves tiles between workflow runs
- **Cache strategy**:
  - Restore cache after Jekyll build
  - Generate and cache tiles (if needed)
  - Restore cached tiles to `_site/` when skipping regeneration
  - Cache key based on image directory hash for automatic invalidation
- **Safety features**: Warns if cache unavailable, logs all cache operations, fails gracefully
- **Testing**: Confirmed working on demo site (ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar)
- **Impact**: Critical fix prevents tile deletion, enables safe optimization

#### Mobile Navbar Title Wrapping
- Long site titles now wrap naturally on mobile devices instead of overflowing or being cut off
- Hamburger menu right-aligned for better mobile UX
- Flexbox properties adjusted for proper text flow on small screens

#### Mobile Font Size Adjustments
- Added `white-space: normal` to allow proper text wrapping
- Reduced display-4 font size on mobile for better readability
- Works in conjunction with existing height-based responsive design

#### Site Title Wrapping on Mobile
- CSS rules added to enable proper text wrapping for site titles
- Ensures titles display cleanly across all mobile screen sizes
- Tested with various title lengths on different devices

#### Site Description Link Styling
- Fixed link styling on home page for consistent appearance
- Proper theme color application to site description links

### Changed
- Build workflow now includes smart IIIF detection and caching (4 new steps, ~76 lines added)
- Migration framework updated with `README.md` and `index.html` for complete v0.4.1 upgrades

---

## [0.4.1-beta] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: Upgrade Script Comment Deletion
- **Migration script bug fixed**: v0.3.4→v0.4.0 migration was deleting ALL comments from `_config.yml`
- **GitHub Actions workflow bug fixed**: Workflow was using `yaml.dump()` which stripped all comments after migration
- **Comment restoration added**: v0.4.0→v0.4.1 migration now detects and restores 13 types of missing comments
- **Comments restored**: Site Settings, Story Interface, PLEASE DO NOT EDIT warning, Collections, Build Settings, Defaults, Telar Settings, Plugins, WEBrick, Development & Testing, Christmas Tree Mode, and all setup instructions
- Root cause: `_ensure_google_sheets_comments()` in v034_to_v040.py used destructive `while loop + pop()` pattern
- Secondary cause: Workflow step "Update version in _config.yml" used `yaml.safe_load()` + `yaml.dump()` after migrations
- Impact: Users upgrading from v0.3.4 to v0.4.0 lost all documentation in their config files
- **Note for users**: After upgrading to v0.4.1, you need to update your `.github/workflows/upgrade.yml` file ONCE (see upgrade instructions)

#### CRITICAL: Mobile Responsive Features Restored
- **Complete mobile code recovery**: Restored ~1,300 lines of mobile responsive code accidentally lost in v0.4.0 release

- **Mobile panel UI**: Fixed-size panels with stacking visibility and proper viewport positioning
- **Graceful panel transitions**: Navigation cooldown, skeleton shimmer loading, fade-only transitions on mobile
- **Mobile preloading**: Aggressive ±2 step preloading on mobile, enhanced 3/2 forward/backward on desktop
- **Offcanvas adjustments**: Progressive typography and spacing reductions for small screens
- **Site-wide scaling**: Consistent mobile experience across all pages
- Root cause: Upstream merge in commit f62acee overwrote local mobile development
- Impact: Major regression fix - restores complete mobile UX from v0.4.0

### Added

#### Object Gallery Mobile Layout
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Single column layout up to 441px width, two columns from 442px-768px
- **Explicit column control**: Replaced auto-fill grid behavior with explicit column counts for predictable mobile layout
- **iPhone Pro Max optimization**: 440px width devices display single column for optimal readability

## [0.3.1-beta] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- **Critical thumbnail loading bug**: Fixed thumbnails not displaying on objects page due to empty string handling in Liquid templates. Objects with empty `thumbnail` or `iiif_manifest` values now properly fall through to appropriate fallback logic.
- **Local image viewer bug**: Fixed local images (self-hosted IIIF) not loading in object detail pages due to empty `iiif_manifest` string being treated as truthy in Liquid conditionals.
- **Objects gallery thumbnails**: Fixed local image thumbnails not loading in objects gallery by adding non-empty string checks to all `iiif_manifest` conditionals.

## [0.3.0-beta] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- **Google Sheets integration**: Config-based workflow supporting both GitHub Pages and local development. Users paste shared and published URLs into `_config.yml` for automatic GID discovery and CSV fetching. No GitHub Secrets required.
  - `fetch_google_sheets.py` script for local CSV fetching
  - `discover_sheet_gids.py` for automatic tab GID discovery from published sheets
  - Excel template with demo data at `docs/google_sheets_integration/telar-template.xlsx`
  - Google Sheets Template available and can easily be duplicated, at https://bit.ly/telar-template
  - Local development guide at `docs/google_sheets_integration/README.md`
  - **Instruction rows and columns**: Add notes and instructions directly in Google Sheets or CSVs that are automatically filtered out during processing
    - Rows starting with `#` are skipped (useful for section breaks, TODOs, and temporary comments)
    - Columns with names starting with `#` (e.g., `# Instructions`, `# Notes`) are ignored during JSON conversion
    - Template includes `# Instructions` column with examples for user guidance
- **Comprehensive error messaging system**: User-friendly warnings displayed on index, objects, and story pages when configuration issues are detected
- **Object ID validation**: Automatic stripping of file extensions from object IDs and warnings for spaces in filenames
- **IIIF manifest validation**: Full validation of external IIIF manifests with detailed error messages
- **Thumbnail validation**: Automatic detection and clearing of invalid thumbnail values (placeholders, non-image files)
- **Build-time warnings**: Console logging with structured [INFO] and [WARN] messages during CSV to JSON conversion
- **Index page issue summary**: Context-aware warnings that link directly to affected objects or stories
- **Objects gallery warnings**: Summary of all objects with configuration issues with links to details
- **Story intro warnings**: Display of configuration issues before users scroll, preventing confusion
- **Panel error handling**: JavaScript-based detection and display of missing images in panel content
- **IIIF manifest copy button**: Object pages now display the full IIIF manifest URL in a copyable code box with one-click copy functionality
- **Individual coordinate copy buttons**: Each coordinate (X, Y, Zoom) in the coordinate identification panel now has its own copy button for quick copying of individual values
- **Theme system**: Flexible theming system with 4 preset themes and support for custom themes
  - Preset themes: Paisajes Coloniales (default), Neogranadina, Santa Barbara, and Austin
  - Easy theme switching via `_config.yml` with single-line configuration
  - Customizable colors (primary, secondary, panel backgrounds) and fonts (headings, body)
  - Advanced users can create `_data/themes/custom.yml` for fully custom themes (gitignored by default)
  - Dynamic CSS generation using SCSS with Liquid templating

### Fixed

- **Orphaned file cleanup**: generate_collections.py now properly removes old files before generating new ones, preventing stale content

### Changed

- **Default content management**: Google Sheets is now the recommended default workflow, with CSV files as an optional alternative for users who prefer direct file editing
- **Error message clarity**: All user-facing errors reference "configuration CSV or Google Sheet" for clarity
- **Object warning field**: Added object_warning to Jekyll collection frontmatter for template access
- **Objects CSV column order**: Moved iiif_manifest to position 4 (after description) for better visibility and logical grouping
- **Story CSV column order**: Reordered columns to group related fields - object and coordinates (x, y, zoom) now appear at start after step number, followed by question/answer, then panel configuration
- **Story intro layout**: Intro slide now appears in the narrative column (left side) instead of full-screen, with step 1's viewer visible immediately on the right for a cleaner, more consistent experience
- **Glossary page styling**: Glossary term links now use theme link colors and body font for consistent theming
- **Glossary navigation**: Clicking glossary terms on the glossary index page now opens a slide-over panel instead of navigating to separate pages, providing a smoother browsing experience
  - Panels slide away and then back in when switching between terms for smooth transitions
  - Glossary panels are narrower than story layer 2 panels (45% vs 55%) for clear visual hierarchy
  - Back button added to glossary panel header for easy dismissal, matching story panel design
- **Theme fallback system**: Multi-tier protection against theme configuration errors
  - Three types of error detection: missing theme, malformed YAML, or critical system failure
  - Automatic fallback to paisajes (default) theme when configured theme is unavailable
  - Protected fallback copy in `scripts/defaults/themes/` as ultimate backup
  - Hardcoded CSS defaults ensure site functions even if all theme files are damaged
  - User-friendly warning messages on index page explain issues and suggest fixes

### Removed

- **Deprecated glossary CSV workflow**: Glossary feature now sources content exclusively from markdown files in `_glossary/`. CSV-based glossary input has been removed.
- **Non-functional project.csv fields**: Removed `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `font_headings`, and `font_body` from `project.csv` (these values were not being used by templates). Theme customization now handled via the new theme system in `_data/themes/`.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **Scrolling system overhaul**: Replaced Scrollama library with custom discrete step-based card stacking architecture to enable **multiple IIIF objects within a single story**. Each object gets its own preloaded viewer card that slides up/down as users navigate through steps.
- **Animation timing**: Reduced viewer pan/zoom animation duration from 36 seconds to 4 seconds for more natural pacing
- **Cleaner viewer UI**: Hidden UniversalViewer color picker and adjustment panels for distraction-free viewing

### Fixed

- **Critical navigation bug**: Fixed viewer cards getting stuck or invisible after backward→forward navigation cycles
- **Z-index layering**: Resolved issue where reused viewer cards appeared behind currently visible cards
- **State management**: Added complete state reset when reusing viewer cards (clears inline styles, transitions, opacity)
- **Intro handling**: Improved viewer reference management when navigating to/from story intro

### Added

- **Story 2 showcase**: Added comprehensive demo story with rich media examples (images, videos, markdown formatting)
- **Enhanced logging**: Improved console debugging messages for bounds checking and state transitions

## [0.1.1-beta] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- Fixed IIIF thumbnails loading at low resolution on home and objects pages by extracting 400px canvas images instead of tiny thumbnail properties
- Fixed markdown syntax not rendering in panels by adding markdown-to-HTML conversion in csv_to_json.py script
- Added comprehensive footnote styling for both panel layers with proper contrast and visual hierarchy
- Added markdown module to requirements.txt for GitHub Actions CI/CD compatibility
- Fixed image URLs in slide-over panels not working when site is deployed to subdirectories by automatically detecting and prepending the base URL
